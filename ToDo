- test if all the variables used in an expression are already defined (This would help finding the mistake in the yaml file)
- rename the method Model.section_subdict Model.get_subdict_of_model_section
- use section_pandas_df 
-try to shorten the init method of Model so that only the complete_dict is created and everything else is done on demand

New Webform

 Construction sites where somenthing could be done:
 -tests for the javascript stuff or the whole webinterface
 -CSS/Javascript Framework integration for adaptability to different screen sizes
 -public server with most of the possible images (and some other computationally expensive results) cached and ways to look at models but not to change them.
 -caching of images and intermediate results
- automate start of application (manage runserver...) and browser window
- integrate units and dimensions in a sensible way
- Javascript for Matrices (Jacob)
