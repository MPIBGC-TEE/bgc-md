  \includegraphics<1,2,3>[width=0.6\textwidth]{ParticleAge.pdf}
  \note<1>{
  We can define the age of a particle with respect to the reservoir as the time it has spent in it.
  In the case of the human population this refers to the age in common sense.
  But in general the age refers not to the time of creation but to the time the reservoir was entered.
  If the reservoir in question is e.g. the soil and the particle a $^{14}C$ atom that entered the soil 5 minutes ago
  it is at least 
  possible that the atom is as old as the universe while its age with respect to the soil is only 5 minutes}
  
\begin{itemize}
     \item <2> The ``age '' is always defined in \emph{context} of the reservoir

   \item Which set of particles to use for the average?\\ 
      proposition:

      $\rightarrow$ usually depends on input rates as well as the dynamics of the system.

  \bar a(t) =\frac{a_1+a_2+\cdots+a_N}{N}
  \]
  With $N=N(t)$ the number of all particles in the reservoir at time $t$.
%\end{tabular}
  \note{To compute the average age of the population  of the world at a given time we would have to ask everybody how old he is and then compute the mean value.
  If we treat this room as a reservoir everybody would have started a stopwatch entering the room, press the stop button now and we would have to add all the times and divide them by the number of people.}

\begin{itemize}
   \item Can be time dependent as well
      \pause
   \item Includes only the subset of particles that are just leaving at the given time.
   (Can only be computed when there is an output stream)
   %\item could be independent of input rates and only depend on the dynamics of the system.
\end{itemize}
\note{In the example of the world population it would be sufficient to observe the grave yards.
We would investigate the birth date of every person who dies and compute the average of the live spans. We ignore all the people still alive and concentrate only on the people just dying.
In this room it would be hard to compute the average transit time right now, because nobody is leaving at the moment. (dropping of to sleep does not count as leaving).
But we could after the talk.
Every person would press the stop bottom at its watch in the moment she passes the door.
If two or more people would leave in the same moment we could compute the average of the
times.

		Pool descriptions condense complex information to a time series of pool changes.(A series of stamps in the passport)

		There are many possible statistics on sets of these time series,
		usually related to numbers of particles and times.
		(e.g. the number of particles in a pool,

		Pool {\color{red} Models} predict = model some of these {\color{red} exclusively} with respect to

\frametitle{Summary}
  \begin{itemize}
      \item
        Pool models greatly simplify:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item The questions (that can be) asked
        \item The way questions are answered by exploiting symmetries 
      \end{itemize}
      \item
        Natural descriptive statistics are time related distributions (age and transit time , per pool per system ...)
      \item
        The simplest and most prominet pool models with the most theory are 
        ``well mixed '' or ``compartmental systems'' modeled by ordinary differential equations.
      \item
        Much more general pool models are possible including non constant deathrates (age selection functions)  or delays,  that have to be solved with different mathematical tools.
        ( partial differential equations,  integral equations, delay equations, Monte Carlo simulations ... ) still much simpler than the underlying complete models.
