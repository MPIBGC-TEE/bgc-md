  \includegraphics<1,2,3>[width=0.6\textwidth]{ParticleAge.pdf}
  \note<1>{
  We can define the age of a particle with respect to the reservoir as the time it has spent in it.
  In the case of the human population this refers to the age in common sense.
  But in general the age refers not to the time of creation but to the time the reservoir was entered.
  If the reservoir in question is e.g. the soil and the particle a $^{14}C$ atom that entered the soil 5 minutes ago
  it is at least 
  possible that the atom is as old as the universe while its age with respect to the soil is only 5 minutes}
  
\begin{itemize}
     \item <2> The ``age '' is always defined in \emph{context} of the reservoir

  \note{To compute the average age of the population  of the world at a given time we would have to ask everybody how old he is and then compute the mean value.

   %\item could be independent of input rates and only depend on the dynamics of the system.
\end{itemize}
\note{In the example of the world population it would be sufficient to observe the grave yards.
We would investigate the birth date of every person who dies and compute the average of the live spans. We ignore all the people still alive and concentrate only on the people just dying.
In this room it would be hard to compute the average transit time right now, because nobody is leaving at the moment. (dropping of to sleep does not count as leaving).
But we could after the talk.
Every person would press the stop bottom at its watch in the moment she passes the door.
If two or more people would leave in the same moment we could compute the average of the
times.

%      Manzoni,Katul,Porporato 2009:\\
%      ``for any linear systems  the transit time
%      distribution is the output flow resulting from an impulsive
%      unitary input.''
%   \begin{eqnarray*}
%      O(t)&=&\int_{0}^{\infty} \psi(T)I(t-T)dT

%\frametitle{Conclusions and outlook}
%\begin{itemize}
%      \pause
%   \item The previously available methods for the computation of mean ages and mean transit times
%      may lead to confusing interpretations if applied to time invariant systems.
%      \pause
%   \item One more generally applicable set of definitions has been proposed.
%      \pause
%   \item A numerical method has been (partly) developed to obtain the desired values for 
%      nonlinear, coupled, time variant systems.
%      \pause
%   \item The method has to be applied to coupled open systems
%      \pause
%   \item Other definitions of mean age and transit times could be evaluated for suitability.
