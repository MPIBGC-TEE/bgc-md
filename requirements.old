# To avoid the official package pytexit-0.1.8 which has an error 
# we demand version ==0.1.9 explicitly 
# If the package has not been installed yet setuptools or pip will
# try to find it on pypy and fail 
# In our repository we can easily install Holgers hanged version
# by running
# python3 SoilR/Code/packageTests/pytexit-0.1.9 setup.py develop
# If we want to make the package public we have to provide
# an url (e.g. on github) in the dependency_links argument  
# in setup.py
