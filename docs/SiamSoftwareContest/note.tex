\section{Introduction}
The presented software framework consists of three open source python packages, 
that serve to represent, classify and analyse compartmental systems of ordinary differential equations (see \Defref{def:compartmentalModel} in \Appendixref{App:Models})with special emphasis on the computation of age and transit time densities of the content.  
The packages do not have a graphical user interface and are meant to be used together with other open source software e.g. \href{jupyter.org}{jupyter}. 

\subsection{CompartmentalSystems package}
\url{https://github.com/MPIBGC-TEE/CompartmentalSystems}\\
The package allows the computation of ages and transit times for nonlinear, non autonomous well mixed compartmental systems.
A brief summary is found under the link above. A more detailed description of the concepts and their application is given in \citet[]{MetzlerMuellerSierra2018PNAS}. A preprint is attached \url{./PNAS.pdf}.
An example \href{jupyter.org}{jupyter} notebook that shows how to use the package can be found here:
\url{http://compartmentalsystems.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_downloads/nonl_gcm_3p.html}

\subsection{LAPM package}
\url{https://github.com/MPIBGC-TEE/LAPM}\\
LAPM stands for {\bf L}inear {\bf A}utonomous {\bf P}ool {\bf M}odels. It provides a class LinearAutonomousPoolModels that allows the \emph{symbolic} computation of transit time, system age, and pool ages.
Since transit time and system age are phase-type distributed, the computations of them rely on properties of this distribution. They are treated in a separate module.
LAPM can be seen as a symbolic companion to CompartmentalSystems for the special case of linear autonomous compartmental systems.


\subsection{The biogeochemical model data base}
\url{https://github.com/MPIBGC-TEE/bgc-md}\\
Short summaries are found under the link above or on our group website \url{https://www.bgc-jena.mpg.de/TEE/software/bgc-md/}.
The package provides: 
\begin{enumerate} 
	\item
	Collections of \href{https://github.com/MPIBGC-TEE/bgc-md/tree/master/bgc_md/data/all_records}{yaml files} each encoding a published carbon cycling model  
	
	\item 
		The code to produce (at the moment still static) \href{https://www.bgc-jena.mpg.de/TEE/software/bgc-md/vegetation/list_report_v.html}{html} for user specified queries or can be used in a \href{https://github.com/MPIBGC-TEE/bgc-md/blob/master/jupyter_notebooks/Examples/how_to_apply_toolkit_to_yaml_model.ipynb}{jupyter notebook}. 
\end{enumerate} 
The software simplifies the abstract description of element cycling models and introduces a yaml format to store them. It uses a symbolic mathematical representation based on \href{http://www.sympy.org/en/index.htmlhttp://www.sympy.org/en/index.html}{sympy} but also allows immediate numerical computations using \href{https://scipy.org/}{scipy} and our own packages \href{https://github.com/MPIBGC-TEE/CompartmentalSystems}{CompartmentalSystems} and \href{https://github.com/MPIBGC-TEE/LAPM}{LAPM}. 
Its main use is to make complex models immediately available for further investigation e.g. in jupyter notebooks, but it also provides a command-line tool to build html reports about single models or sets. Users can create their own templates and yaml files.
We are developing a web front end that makes it possible to run the whole database as a website with a graphical JavaScript based user interface. The GUI further simplifies the creation of the database entries. 



\section{Installation, documentation and demonstrations}


\subsection{Installation}
For the purpose of the contest it suffices to install \href{https://github.com/MPIBGC-TEE/bgc-md}{bgc-md} because it will draw in the other packages as dependencies. Detailed instructions are found \href{https://github.com/MPIBGC-TEE/bgc-md#installation}{here}.
The installation is tested for linux systems. Since the only dependencies are \href{https://pandoc.org/installing.html}{pandoc} and python3 it should be possible to be used on windows or macOs but we do not maintain installation instructions for these operating systems.
Instead we provide docker images that are ready to run. {\color{red} I have to upload them to  docker so that they can be installed easily by the users and explain the installation command}


\subsection{Documentation}
CompartmentalSystems has a complete \href{http://compartmentalsystems.readthedocs.io/en/latest/}{documentation}.
So has \href{http://lapm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/}{LAPM}. The bgc-md package has the documentantion of the commandline tool wich is available after installation \texttt{render -h} 
and is otherwise mostly documented by the report templates, which are constantly tested automatically.

\subsection{Demonstration}
To see how bgc-md can be used in conjuction with the other packages look at the foolwing \href{https://github.com/MPIBGC-TEE/bgc-md/blob/master/jupyter_notebooks/Examples/how_to_apply_toolkit_to_yaml_model.ipynb}{jupyter notebook}.
To be able to see the command-line tool in action you have to install the package and make sure that your virtual environment is activated. 
To check that you have done so succesfully, type \texttt{render -h} which should show the help.
In the folder \texttt{bgc-md/docs/SiamSoftwareContest/} we provided a small shell script that contains an example call. 
Then run \texttt{./demo1.sh} (which will take some time).
Afterward you can look at the result with a web browser.
\texttt{firefox output/TECO/CompleteSingleModelReport.html}.
To see an overview report run: \texttt{./demo2.sh} and look at: \texttt{output22/Website.htm}

{\color{red} I have to update the template for the model links in the website}

\section{Compartmental systems}
\label{App:Models}
For the purpose of understanding the applications of the software it suffices to interpret
all state variables as contents of reservoirs.
In the following we treat here reservoir, pool, and compartmental systems as synonymous, 
and use relevant definitions from \citet[][and references therein]{Jacquez1993SIAM}. 
The interpretation easiest to imagine is content measured in units of mass stored in a reservoir defined by its spatial boundaries.
However, reservoirs as well as contents can be much more abstract. 
\begin{definition}[Compartmental system]
	\label{def:compartmentalModel} 
	Let 
	$F_{i,j}$  be the flux from pool $j$  to pool $i ,\text{ for all } i,j\ne i \in \{1 \dots n \}$,
	$F_{i,0}=I_i$ define the influx to pool $i$ 
	and 
	$F_{0,i}=O_i$ the outflux from pool $i$. \\ 
	If 
	$F_{i,j}(\vec{C},t)	\ge  0 ,\text{ for all } i,j \in \{0 \dots n\} $ and
	\begin{align}
	\label{enum:ZeroFlux}	
	C_j=0 			\implies  F_{i,j}(\vec{C},t)=0
	\end{align}
	we call the ODE system: 
	\begin{align}
	\label{eq:internalMassBalance}
	\dot{C}_i=	\sum_{i=0.i\ne j}(-F_{j,i}(\vec{C},t)+F_{i,j}(\vec{C},t)) \quad{\forall i}
	\end{align}
	\emph{compartmental}.
\end{definition}

	\caption{
     	\label{fig:3PoolsFeedBackWaterM}
	A compartmental model with three pools and all possible
	connections between the pools and the environment.  
	%The fluxes between pools
	%$F_{k,l}(\vec{C}$,$t) \ge 0 $ with  $F_{k,l}(\vec{C}$,$t) =0$ for
	%$C_k=0 $ 
	%are a necessary part of the definition.  
	Note that the flux between pool$_k$ and pool$_l$ is considered a property of the
	\emph{pipeline}, meaning the flux from pool$_k$ into the pipeline is the
	same as the flux out of the pipeline into pool$_k$.  
	This ensures mass balance for all fluxes and pools and also for the model as a whole, and
	makes this the prototype or normal form of mass balanced models with
	internal connections.  
	Every model that can be drawn in this
	form is mass balanced.  Examples are not limited to networks of
	pipelines and reservoirs of fluids. Instead of a fluid the total amount
	of a chemical element in different chemical substances (represented by
	the pools) can be described by it.
	}
\end{figure}
Remarks:\\
The conditions guarantee mass balance, non-negative fluxes,
and ensure that there cannot be any flux out of an empty pool.
For non-negative initial values $\vec{C}_0\in \Rbb{n}$ the pool contents stay non-negative for  $t\ge t_0$.
