# Circular dependency with A_g -> see equation in page 11.
######## Model's Source Code ############
#   - comveg.h: This file describes the variables used in other siles.
#       there is a variable for each PFTs, e.g. ciub, ciuc, cils, cil3, cil4.
#   
#   - physiology.f: This file contains all the relevant equations for photosynthesis
#       line 175 -> ci values are constrained to acceptable bounds.
#       line 218 -> je (here J_e, see function below) is defined as in the paper, using the variables for the PFT: ciub, they also add another coefficient: 4.59e-06
#       line 235 -> calculate agub (here A_g, see below) by solving the quadratic equation in lines 228 - 233.
#       line 425 -> A_g of each PFT (agub, aguc...) is scaled -to the canopy?- = agcub... A_n as well... = ancub
#   - stats.f:
#       lines 99 - 110: tgpp is calculated by multiplying ancub (here A_n) by the frac (fraction of canopy occupied by each plant func    tional type), lai (canopy single-sided leaf area index (area leaf    /area veg)) and fu (fraction of overall area covered by upper cano    py).
#       lines 182 - 226: tnpp is calculated for each PFT from tgpp
#     Attention: NPP used in the ODE is the one calculated yearly (in the source code: aynpp) -> see in vegetation.f the analytical solution to the original carbon balance differential equation
#       line 1117 - 1139 -> tnpp is used to calculate aynpp
# Note: our C_il = cbiol(i,j) in source code (see vegetation.f)
#           C_is = cbiow(i,j)
#           C_ir = cbior(i,j)
##########################################               
#   Conclusion: it seems like in the code they solve the circular dependency issue by calculating C_i first, and then A_g. 
# Also, a "solution" they have for mss balance problems: constrain pool sizes to positive values (see line 404 in vegetation.f), and maintain min value of leaf carbon in regions with plants (line 410).
# And, in their calculations they seem to be are aware of maintaining consistent units.
