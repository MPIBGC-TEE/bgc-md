# We add a parameter NPP_i in the formula for b
# which forces us to do three things also
# 1) declare the variabe NPP_i (which we do in photosynthetic_parameters)
# 2) give a parameter set that at least contains a value for NPP_i to enable the 
#    numeric computations
# 3) add the name of the new parameter set to the model run generations
