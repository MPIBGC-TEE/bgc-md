# Extensions to veg_3.yaml 
# 1.) Add an additional state variable C_ir
#     a ) This will force us to update the state vector as well 
#     b ) we also have to increase the size of the matrix A to 3X3
#     c ) we also have to provide an additional startvalue in the initial value section 
#
# 2.) Describe the state variables and add some meta information to the others
