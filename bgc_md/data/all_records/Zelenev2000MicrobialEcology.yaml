abstract: "Previously, we discovered the phenomenon of wavelike spatial distributions of bacterial populations and total organic carbon (TOC) along wheat roots. We hypothesized that the principal mechanism underlying this phenomenon is a cycle of growth, death, autolysis, and regrowth of bacteria in response to a moving substrate source (root tip). The aims of this research were (i) to create a simulation model describing wavelike patterns of microbial populations in the rhizosphere, and (ii) to investigate by simulation the conditions leading to these patterns. After transformation of observed spatial data to presumed temporal data based on root growth rates, a simulation model was constructed with the Runge-Kutta integration method to simulate the dynamics of colony-forming bacterial biomass, with growth and death rates depending on substrate content so that the rate curves crossed over at a substrate concentration within the range of substrate availability in the model. This model was named \"BACWAVE,\" standing for \"bacterial waves.\" Cyclic dynamics of bacteria were generated by the model that were translated into traveling spatial waves along a moving nutrient source. Parameter values were estimated from calculated initial substrate concentrations and observed microbial distributions along wheat roots by an iterative optimization method. The kinetic parameter estimates fell in the range of values reported in the literature. Calculated microbial biomass values produced spatial fluctuations similar to those obtained for experimental biomass data derived from colony forming units. Concentrations of readily utilizable substrate calculated from biomass dynamics did not mimic measured concentrations of TOC, which consist not only of substrate but also various polymers and humic acids. In conclusion, a moving pulse of nutrients resulting in cycles of growth and death of microorganisms can indeed explain the observed phenomenon of moving microbial waves along roots. This is the first report of wavelike dynamics of microorganisms in soil along a root resulting from the interaction of a single organism group with its substrate."
