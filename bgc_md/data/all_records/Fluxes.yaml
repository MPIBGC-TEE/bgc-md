# the model section should be simplified in the following ways:
# 1. there is now only one subsection: variables
#    If a veriable has special meaning is decided by the keys or the context
#    - A state variable can be identified by looking at the state vector)
#    - A variable that is not a statevariable is a parameter if it is supplied
#      in a paramter set
#    - An external driver is a variable for which an external function is 
#      supplied in the func_set

    # the classification as statevariables is actually duplication 
    # it is here until we get it running withou
