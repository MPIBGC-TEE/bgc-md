This report is the result of the use of the python package bgc_md, as means to translate published models to a common language.  The underlying yaml file was created by Holger Metzler (Orcid ID: 0000-0002-8239-1601) on 17/03/2016.  
  
  
  
## About the model  
  
The model depicted in this document considers soil organic matter decomposition. It was originally described by @Allison2010NatureGeoscience.  
  
  
  
### Keywords  
  
differential equations, nonlinear, time variant, Michaelis-Menten
  
  
### Principles  
  
mass balance, substrate dependence of decomposition, heterogeneity of speed of decay, internal transformations of organic matter, environmental variability effects, substrate interactions
