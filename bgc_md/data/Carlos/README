Assuming that you have activated your virtual env by 
source pathToYourEnv/bin/activate
The commandline tools are available.

generate_model_run_report Rasmussen2016JMB.yaml 

will create a folder Rasmussen2016JMB with all the necessary files in it. 
(You can also specify a target folder. To see the options just run generate_model_run_report without arguments)

To look at the output say: 
firefox Rasmussen2016JMB/Report.html
