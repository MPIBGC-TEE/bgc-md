Some of the tests are very time consuming
The file(s) containing them start with 'SlowTest' instead of 'Test' and are found 
only by the script run_tests_buildbot.py 
The normal quick test suite is run by 'run_test_py'
Of course the file(s) can be run separately for example with 'python SlowTestReportGeneration.py'
