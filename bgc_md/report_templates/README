The two subdirectories of this directory are just a help to distinguish between the different default templates we provide and test. 
You can put templates everywhere.
The commoandlinetool we provide for convinience can call templates that take an object of class  Model  (in single_model folder) or of class ModelList (in folder multiple_model).
The other folders contain templates (like model_run) are either used by templates in the first two folders or by (possibly your own code) that provides the correct arguments.
