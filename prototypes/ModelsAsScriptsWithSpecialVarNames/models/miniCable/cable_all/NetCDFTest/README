We build the fortran (netcdffortran) and python (nectdf4_python) bindings with mpi enabled.
This allows parallel IO which allows us to write to a single file from all processors simultaneously 
which helps us to avoid the very complicated IO of cable (which sends all results to a master who writes the files) 
without the need to create a single file for every node in the cluster.
This is the recommended IO for clusters anyway ...
On the python side we can also read simultaniously from the same file. The number of processes will be 
much bigger here since the python code will be embarresingly parallel (no communication between the processors)
Since we use one netcdf file we can distribute the work independently from how cable did it.
This avoids a lot of bookkeeping
