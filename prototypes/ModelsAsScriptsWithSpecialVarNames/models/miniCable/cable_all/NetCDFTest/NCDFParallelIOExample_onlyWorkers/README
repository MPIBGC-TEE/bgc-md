This is a slight variation of the original example from the NetCDF github repo
Only 4 of the 5 processes do the parallel IO
We have to create a new communicator excluding the master 
The processes in this communicator do what the original example did on all processes.
This one step closer to cable which also has a master process.

To build run and check the example type:

make test
