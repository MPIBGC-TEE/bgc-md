This is (nearly) the original example from  https://github.com/Unidata/netcdf-fortran
The purpose is to check the nix expression (to make sure that the libraries are in place and
compiled with parallel support)

To build and run the fortran code
and print the results with a python script

type: make testFortran 


To write and read a testfile with python

type: make testPython
