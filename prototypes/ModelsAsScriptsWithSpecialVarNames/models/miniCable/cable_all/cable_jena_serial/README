1.) Type nix-shell cable.nix 
This will install the environment described in 'cable.nix' which contains the compiler and the netcdf and mpi libraries.
2.) Type source setup.sh
This will setup the paths to the binaries (e.g. mpif90 ) and the include and libpaths needed at compile time and runtime.
It will also define some functions that perform further build steps to produce the executable and run it with specific input files. These functions can be called in the nix-shell after you have sourced the setup file.
